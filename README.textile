h1. Java MSN Library (JML)

JML is a Java library to interact with MSN Messenger via MSNP8-15 protocols.
It is made with performance, thread-safety and ease of use in mind.

h2. Supported JVM

Java 6+ supported, runs on Scala 2 too.

h2. Difference between this and SourceForge repo

SourceForge repository has not been updated since 2013. While MSN Messenger is officially dead, there are community-run
alternative MSN servers around like Escargot. Java MSN Library has several bugs, issues and severe incompatibilities
with MSN Protocol. This repository aims to host an up-to-date JML version with bugfixes and Escargot compatability in
mind.
